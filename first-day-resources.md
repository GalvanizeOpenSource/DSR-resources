## Kristie's Data Science Tips

#### General Advice
* Understanding how to pair-program well is important, don't forget to read this info on it: https://github.com/gSchool/dsi-welcome/blob/master/notes/pairing.md
* We love your feedback! You can submit any problems with assignments on the #dsi_errata slack channel.
* This class is designed to be a bit too fast and a bit too difficult. Take advantage of all of the great opportunities to learn, but also find some time for mental health breaks. If you're finishing half of the assignments every day, reviewing the solutions to learn what you missed, and getting at least 50% on the assessments, you're doing great!
* If you're stuck on one small part of an assignment for more than 30-40 minutes, please ask for help. You'll learn so much more if you can find a way to move past the little things and get an understanding of the big picture lessons for the day.
* There may be days when you feel overwhelmed but if you made it this far, I guarantee you have what it takes. And chances are, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you're not the only one!


#### Helpful Atom Packages
Go to Packages -> Settings View -> Install Packages/Themes to find these.

* linter-pyflakes: This package is amazing. It highlights syntax errors and other small mistakes in your code before you even run it!
* local-history: This package keeps a history of all changes to your file so you can revert to whatever version you need. Prioritize using Github for version control, but when you inevitably forget to make a commit or two, this will definitely come in handy.
* click-link: So you can actually click on links in md files. Not essential but if you get angry having to copy & paste links, you may appreciate this.
* python-autopep8: Also not essential but it's a good habit to learn how to format your code according to best practices.
